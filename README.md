# Bloodsync
BloodSync is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of blood donation and distribution. The platform connects voluntary blood donors with hospitals and medical institutions in need of specific blood types. Donors can register, update their availability, and receive notifications when their blood type is in demand nearby. Hospitals can post blood requests, specifying the required type, quantity, and urgency. The system automatically matches available donors with hospital needs, ensuring faster and more efficient responses to emergencies and routine transfusion requirements. By bridging the gap between supply and demand, BloodSync enhances the accessibility, reliability, and coordination of blood donation services.
